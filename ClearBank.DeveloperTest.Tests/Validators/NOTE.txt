The validator unit tests are all very similar, and could easily share a <Generic> base class to cut away a lot of the code 
duplication, however, I have generally found that unit tests should be a simple as possible (not over-engineered) to avoid mistakes in
the tests and make them easy to understand and follow (KISS).
